Besides being the foundation of most popular cryptocurrencies, blockchain also promises to be a disruptive technological concept for various areas such as smart mobility. Blockchain enables new use cases and business possibilities that might benefit from the advantages that the technology provides.
In this work, we present an implementation of a decentralized car marketplace based on the Ethereum platform. By leveraging the idea of digital assets and the temper-proof nature of blockchains, we can provide assurances regarding vehicle information to customers. The results show that our smart contracts can cover core features of a car marketplace. Additionally, they enable customer trust and allow a secure ownership transfer without an intermediary third-party. However, there are still challenges that have to be addressed in future work.
